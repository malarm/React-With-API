<p> This website is made for a company which rents out summer houses to its clients. There are two main features in this website.
              The first feature is to show the property details .Using my front-end skills I help the product owner (company owner) show property
                 details such as property picture, number of bedrooms, guest counts, city and price per night. </p>
              <p>The second important feature is to show tarrif range in the filter. As the product owner has umpteen number of summer houses,
                 I have added the tarrif range in the filter, in order to help the clients  select the summer houses based on their affordability.</p>
              <p>Used Technologies : React, HTML5, CSS3 And API</p>
